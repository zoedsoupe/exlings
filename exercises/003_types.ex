# Elixir has several basic types:
# - Atoms start with : like :hello
# - Strings are in double quotes like "world"
# - Numbers are just numbers like 42
#
# Fix the code below:

my_atom = ???  # Should be :hello
my_string = ???  # Should be "world"
my_number = ???  # Should be 42

IO.puts("atom: #{inspect(my_atom)}, string: #{my_string}, number: #{my_number}")

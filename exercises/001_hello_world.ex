# Welcome to Exlings!
#
# Congratulations on taking your first step into the world of Elixir!
#
# Elixir is a dynamic, functional programming language designed for
# building scalable and maintainable applications. It runs on the
# Erlang VM (BEAM), which is known for creating low-latency,
# distributed, and fault-tolerant systems.
#
# Let's start with the traditional first program: "Hello, World!"
#
# What you'll learn:
# - How to print text to the screen using IO.puts/1
# - The concept of functions and arguments in Elixir
# - Your first working Elixir program!
#
# In Elixir, we use the IO.puts/1 function to print text.
#
# Breaking it down:
#   IO       - This is a module (a collection of related functions)
#   .puts    - This is a function in the IO module
#   /1       - This means the function takes 1 argument
#
# The argument should be a string (text in double quotes).
#
# Example: IO.puts("Hello!")
#
# Your task:
# Fix the code below by adding the string "Hello, World!" as an
# argument to IO.puts()

IO.puts()
